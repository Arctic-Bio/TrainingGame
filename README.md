#Training Game

The goal of this game is to teach the rules that govern the system rather than to achieve the highest score.

I need a novel architecture for an AI algorithm that does not simply aim for system optimization. Instead, it should focus on learning the underlying rules by breaking the system into the most important concepts within each quadrant. From there, it develops an understanding of each concept, how it influences the final outcome, and then uses that understanding to produce an output. These concepts are discovered as either obstacles or aids to a central goal, such as reaching the end of a puzzle, completing a maze, or adhering to standard sentence formation rules.

Imagine an AI navigating an adaptive video game that changes with each iteration. It cannot be trained to follow a single optimal path. Instead, it learns the function of each element so that it can make informed decisions, avoid traps, and adapt to new challenges. The focus is on training intelligence rather than memorizing a route.

The process can be summarized as: Concept, Simplify, Abstract, Compare and Contrast, Deduce, Extend, Rebuild, Organize, Review.
