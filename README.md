# TrainingGame
The goal of this game is to teach the rules dictating the game, not expect the maximum score.


I need a novel architecture for a AI algorythim that instead of learning the system maximum like most do it instead attempts to learn the rules by breaking the system up into "Most important concepts for quadrants, and from there creating an udnerstanding of each of these concepts and how they impact the final result and then utilizing them to return an output. 

Think of an AI that goes through an adaptive video game that changes each time. You cannot teach it to follow one path and find the fastest version, but you can train it to understand what each thing does and then it can navigate it while avoiding traps and such. We are training the intelligence not the route.
